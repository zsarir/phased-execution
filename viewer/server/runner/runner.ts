/**
 * The phase loop.
 *
 * For each ready phase: check its gate, claim its lock, ask the engine for the
 * boot prompt, run it as one `claude -p` process, and then — the part that
 * matters — **check the work independently**. The session's own report is
 * evidence, not proof: it is the same session whose job it was to succeed. So
 * the runner re-runs the plan's verification commands, re-lints, and re-reads
 * the board from disk. A phase advances only when all three agree.
 *
 * Two resumes, both required and quite different:
 *
 *   **Plan-level** — fresh or half-finished is the same code path. `--memory-block`
 *   derives ready from the done-*set*, so a plan with 1, 4 and 5 done and 2, 3
 *   outstanding needs no cursor and no special case. There is deliberately no
 *   "current phase" stored anywhere; the board is the truth.
 *
 *   **Run-level** — a console that died mid-phase left a child behind. That is
 *   reconciled explicitly (`adopt`) and never guessed at: a phase that may have
 *   half-committed is parked for a person, not silently re-run.
 *
 * Concurrency is deliberately one run at a time. Two sessions editing one
 * working tree is not parallelism, it is a merge conflict with extra steps.
